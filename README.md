🏡 Real-Time Social Media Analytics Pipeline

📌 Overview

This project aims to build a real-time social media analytics pipeline to extract meaningful insights from various platforms. It includes sentiment analysis, hashtag clustering, and engagement prediction using machine learning models.

The system processes high-velocity data, enabling businesses and researchers to monitor trends and user engagement efficiently.

🚀 Tech Stack Used

🐍 Python – for data processing and model training📊 Google Colab – for dataset analysis and model development🌐 Flask – for web framework and deployment🤖 Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow – for machine learning models📈 Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation📉 Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – for data visualization💾 Joblib – for model saving/loading

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes various features such as:
✔ Social media text content✔ Hashtags and keywords✔ Likes, shares, and comments✔ User engagement metrics✔ Sentiment scores

🛠 Preprocessing Steps:

✅ Handling missing values✅ Encoding categorical variables✅ Normalizing numerical features✅ Removing stopwords and special characters from text

🔥 Model Training Process

📌 Data Preprocessing:

✅ Tokenization and text cleaning✅ Feature scaling for numerical data

🏆 Model Selection & Training:

✅ Sentiment Analysis using VADER✅ Hashtag Clustering using TF-IDF and K-Means✅ Engagement Prediction using Random Forest✅ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

📊 Model Evaluation:

✅ Silhouette Score for clustering✅ Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression models✅ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)✅ F1 Score, Accuracy for classification tasks

📈 Visualization Techniques:

✅ Word Clouds for trending topics✅ Correlation heatmaps✅ Cluster distribution plots✅ Model performance graphs
